# Solution

The application helps the user to find his/her car in the list of registered car. There are two different types of filtering the data. Firstly, there is selection of make and model from the data in backend. After that user can also filter data via fuel and body type using searchbar. This way make it easier to find user's car.

After selecting the one, user can view details of vehicle and confirm the choice or cancel it and come back to the list of available vehicles.
